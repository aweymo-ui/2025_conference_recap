## Introduction

<br>

This fall, I had the opportunity to speak at three conferences. They were three fairly distinct groups of people, which is a great but also challenging thing about being a librarian: you aren’t stuck with the same people at the same conferences every year, but you are also often the least experienced person whatever discipline you happen to be trespassing on that day. That said, I think most of the people were receptive to seeing how people from other areas are engaging with their focus. 

**Here are some of the talks that stood out to me, as well as a brief summary of what I was speaking about.**

<br>

## Western Association of Map Libraries

<br>

Beginning with the Western Association of Map Libraries, which took place here in Moscow. As someone who has only attended GIS Day other mapping conference experience, I was surprised how much these talks had to do with the physical reality of working with this material. Beginning with “Maps I’m Mad At” by Meg Dyer from University of Georgia, it was a very eye-opening talk about the practical realities of organizing large scale physical map collections, where major cataloguing efforts are a decades long effort and archivists really inherit past initiatives from former colleagues. 

Dulce discussed the Latah County Historic Places digital collection and I thought it was an interesting examination of paper vs. digital real world practicality. Similarly, Laura Krueger from the David Rumsey Map center at Stanford discussed “GitHub for Catalogers,” in a hyper pragmatic approach for long, medium and short term task management.

<br>

I met a very interesting person named Heiko Mühr from the Earth Sciences & Map Library at UC Berkeley, who was previously an oral history librarian, and happened to have a lot of great feedback for the presentation I was giving that day: “Using Geographic Visualizations to Enrich Oral History Recordings.” The talk was based on my experience working with Google Earth Studio to guide listeners through stories about the Taylor Wilderness Research Center, to help add context to visitors of that digital collection.

<br>

I also discussed some non-proprietary, programmatic approaches we could experiment with to possibly add this feature to our department’s Oral History as Data platform. I also talked about other ways geographic context could be used to follow archival documents in the way we might oral history recordings, in this example, following a text and photographic scrapbook of a Filipino "Alaskero" cannery worker along his circuit from San Francisco to Kodiak Island, Alaska.

## Visual Resources Association

<br>

About a week later, I was over in Portland for the Visual Resources Association conference. While I was only able to register for the day I was speaking, there were still some really interesting speakers. The VRA has its origins in more of a fine art curation and preservation that was representative in Astrid Runggaldier,  Meghan Rubenstein and Wen Nie Ng’s “Ethical and Practical Approaches to AI in Visual Collections and the Classroom.” The speakers from University of Texas and Colorado College described a curriculum where they had art students describe different textile material styles, techniques and geographic origins and then had LLM models do the same, and had the student note the lack of detail, errors and robo-racism that frequently occurred, where so many models interpret anything non-European as simply “exotic”. A pretty straightforward, but instructive and confidence building exercise for graduate students to keep developing their research and description skills.

Concetta Barbara, Archivist for Michael Curry Design company, that most famously created all of the practical puppetry and costumes for the theatrical run of the Lion King, discussed the pros and cons of working for a private archive. Barbara talked about the difficulty in communicating archival practice with people accustomed to stuffing everything in tupperware containers for safe keeping, as well as a really interesting tangent around how to maintain archival best practices when you are working with Disney IP that needs to be completely destroyed if you decide to weed those items from the collection.

After Nora Davies from Smith College discussed a very interesting, practical approach to digitizing giant banners using a controlled lighting setup and stitching fragments together in photoshop, I presented, “Image Extraction for Overhead Scans and Archeological Photographs.” 

<br>

<br>

The talk went over two tools I developed in Python, one that would extract archeological objects out of "context photographs", using this sample from an dig at our local Moscow High School, from a project that Evan is currently working on. The other tool identifies individual photos from an overhead scan and exports them individually with sequential file names for reference.

## Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Society of Architectural Historians

<br>

After my presentation, I needed to drive up to Tacoma for the Society of Architectural Historian’s Northwest Chapter “mini-conference,” "Resist, Reclaim, Restore: Preserving an Inclusive Heritage." The following day, the conference began with a tour of Historic Black Sites around the Hilltop Neighborhood, where I used to live. The tour happened to be led by Monette Hearn, of Black Historic Sites, Washington who just so happened to be working at the Tacoma Public Library Northwest Room at the same time as I was working at the archive. It was deep pandemic, so it was good to reconnect without the masks for the first time. The tour continued a very close-quarters van and ferry ride over to Vashon Island, where we were guided around the historic Japanese American Mukai Farm and Garden.

The following day, the schedule was absolutely packed with great cultural heritage, architecture and urban planning related talks. The majority of the speakers worked for independent firms in Portland and Seattle doing assessment for historic sites, but there were also folks from academia, too.

<br>

Starting off, 2025 CDIL Fellowship recipient Shelley Walker-Harmon walked through some U of I history with “What’s in a Name? Archie Phinney Hall and the Politics of Remembrance,” discussing Phinney’s Indigenous heritage and the obfuscation of that part of the building’s narrative, which Walker-Harmon has already improved through her contributions to our Campus Photograph Collection over the summer.

There was a great panel titled “The Counter-Archive: Stories from Outside the Architectural Record, Queer, Native, and South Asian histories.” Particularly of interest was University of Washington’s Urban Planning professor Manish Chalana’s “From Punjab to the Pacific: Honoring and Preserving South Asian Heritage in the U.S. West,” discussing really interesting approaches to working with census data to highlight understudied Pacific Northwest labor history. 

<br>

<br>

I was able to convince Chalana and U of I's America250 contributor Nathan Moody to have lunch, along with most of the other panelists at Pho King, near the Evergreen Tacoma Campus, where the talks were being held. Pho King, situated in an architectural anomaly in its own right, on a single block where there are coincidentally 2 other Pho restaurants, but is, after researching, the superior option. I recommend the 13 and 38 if you are in the area.

That afternoon, I presented my paper “The Tideflats: Distance and Environmental Psychology,” discussing land use of an industrial area just south of Tacoma. One lot was occupied by the largest meat packing plant west of the Mississippi and is currently the location of the Northwest Detention Center, built exactly 100 years after one another. 

<br>

<br>

The paper is around four years in the making and revisiting the work helped me expand on the parallel history concept and refine some theory around how urban planners and architectural historians have understood how a resident’s values, attitudes and intentions can be shaped by distance and perception in our built environment. 

<br>

<br>

Overall, this was a very informative plunge into oral history, mapping, computer vision, Python workflows, cultural heritage and public history that also hopefully promoted the work we are doing here in the library.
